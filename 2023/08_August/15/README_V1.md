## 01

**01**

I had a medium length Bit City session today, playing the game at a slow relaxing rate before I wrapped up and quit. I played casually and got less rapid screenshots than last week. I am focusing now on upgrading buildings, gaining bux, and maxing out upgrades, since I reached a city population of MAX 1.11 Million on 2021 Tuesday September 14th. I have maxed out city 8. I am told there is no city 9, but I feel that there is now. I am still not going to move on until I progress a lot more, basically when all buildings require at least 3 seconds to upgrade.

Progress was very pleasant today, I quit, as I didn't want to spend more time playing. - 2021 October 19th

**86**

I had a very, very short session this week, playing for a little less than 3 minutes. I made 0 bux today (starting with 22,447, and ending with 22,447) my Wi-Fi was acting up, and I didn't feel like playing today to begin with, due to how late I woke up, so I decided to quit early. I am still skeptical on resetting, with all the progress being made, it makes me feel like I don't want to reset. I have now decided that my next level 8 city will be a nature city. I eventually wrapped up and quit. - 2023, Tuesday, June 6th

**88**

I had a very session this week, playing for more than 40 minutes. I made 560 bux today (starting with 22,654, and ending with 42, as I spent 23,182 bux on the final keeper of keys upgrade)

I finally got the 5th keeper of keys upgrade today, it took a few months to save up for it. I am now considering doing all of the upgrades before moving on to the next city.

I had a very long session this week, playing for over 50 minutes. I made 577 bux today (starting with 42, and ending with 551, although I accidentally spent 68 bux during finalization, and had to go back briefly) my motivation today was to increase my bux by at least half, then by at least ten fold. I am still skeptical on resetting, with all the progress being made, it makes me feel like I don't want to reset. I have now decided that my next level 8 city will be a nature city.

## Plans for the next Bit City

When I prestige, and make it back to city 8 (bit city) I have some ideas:

> Industrial city

All buildings are towers (except for the bank, town hall, and dealerships)

> Green city

All buildings are greenery (ponds, forests, shrubs, and other plants) (except for the bank, town hall, and dealerships)

## Plans for return

I considered returning gameplay today during a car trip, but decided to just enjoy the trip instead. I wouldn't be able to use the double time boost anyways, due to no Internet connection. I am likely to come back after I finish this programming language acceleration project. It is coming very close to the finish point. - 2022, Tuesday, November 1st
