# 2023, Wednesday, June 7th - Didn't play

I didn't play Bit City today. Today was not a scheduled day to play.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on Saturday, 2020 October 24th about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the next time slot, which is Tuesday. I will be playing again on 2023, Tuesday, June 13th.

### Possible schedule change

I am considering moving this game from Tuesday to Wednesday (swapping Disco Zoo from Wednesday to Tuesday) this decision is ongoing. If this decision goes through, my next timeslot will be Wednesday, meaning I will be playing again on 2023, Wednesday, June 7th/June 13th.
