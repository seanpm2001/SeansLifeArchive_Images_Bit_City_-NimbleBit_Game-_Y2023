# 2023, Wednesday, January 25th - Didn't play

I didn't play Bit City today. Today was not a scheduled day to play.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on Saturday, 2020 October 24th about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I won't be playing this game again until the new time slot, which is Tuesday. I might be playing again on 2023, Tuesday, January 31st.
